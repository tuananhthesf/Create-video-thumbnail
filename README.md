Simple android tool to create thumbnail of your videos

How to use:

1. Clone project and open with Android Studio
2. Add some video to "raw" folder
3. Run project
4. Open settings in your device, give app Write External Storage permission (Forgive my laziness :P)
5. Click on ImageView
6. Your thumbnail will be save in /sdcard/Pictures/SimpleVideoThumbnail/ with same name as you give it in raw

That's all! Have fun xD
